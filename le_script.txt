[First charged shot]

W- w- Wait what is going on here?!

This gun is definitely not supposed to be that powerful.
What did you input? How did you trigger this?

Oh, wait is it the charged shot feature I just added yesterday?
Oh, no no no no- I can't leave this bug in the hands of a Player, this will totally ruin the balance of the levels!
Give me a second to fix this, don't move an inch, I will be back.


[Solving a puzzle and moving to the second room]

And I am back.
Oh, you moved, didn't you- I told you not to move, what if you had caused another bug?
Then I would have had two bugs to fix; no need to fix something that never gets discovered.
Anyway, I think I fixed it. Can you do that thing again?


[Bug still happens]

Okay nevermind.
I'm gonna try something else so please, seriously don't move this time.


[Player moves a tiny bit]

Don't. [places an obstacle? removes a platform in the middle of a lava lake? (but you can still clear the gap with the charged shot)]


[???]

Noo, there was a whole segment here where you would go down into a dungeon, and there was a huge physics puzzle with water and wind...
Then you would have unlocked a new ability that would allow you to beat the boss, a huge dragon, there were 5 phases and- you just- jumped over it.


[end]

Okay, that's it.
I've had enough. I've had enough of you ruining my game.
If you had just listened to me, we could have had so much fun together, but you had to be like this.
I'm done. I'm leaving.
Have fun bouncing around with your stupid gun in this empty room.
Goodbye.
